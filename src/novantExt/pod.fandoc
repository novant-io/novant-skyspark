Overview [#overview]
********************

The 'novantExt' implements  connector support for the
[Novant]`https://novant.io` Digital Foundation:

  - Read live data from Novant projects
  - Write values back to Novant projects
  - Sync trend data from Novant projects

API Keys [#apiKeys]
*******************

API keys are required to access data from Novant projects.  It's recommended
you create a specific API key just for SkySpark access.  See Novant
documentation for how to create an API key for your project.

Connectors [#conns]
*******************

Each connector in SkySpark maps 1:1 to a Novant project. To create and map a
new connector:

    novantConn
    dis: "My Device"
    novantApiKey: "***********"

Where 'novantApiKey' is the key you generated from the Novant platform.

Cur/Write/His [#curHisWrite]
****************************

Current values are configured using the 'novantCur' tag on a point. Writable
points use the 'novantWrite' tag.  Likewise histories use the 'novantHis' tag.
The value of these tags maps to the point ID for the Novant point, which will
be in the format of '"s.{sourceId}.{pointId}"'.

    point
    dis: "My Point"
    novantCur: "s.1.5"
    novantWrite: "s.1.5"
    novantHis: "s.1.5"
    equipRef: @equip-id
    siteRef: @site-id
    kind: "Number"
    unit: "kW"

The SkySpark write level will be carried over directly into the downstream
I/O device under the Novant gateway.  For protocols that support priority, like
Bacnet, this means the Bacnet priority array level matches the SkySpark write
level. For protocols that do not support priority (such as Modbus) this value
is ignored.

Learn [#learn]
**************

The Novant connector supports learning.  Once a connector has been added, you
can use the Site Builder to walk the device tree and add any or all points.

His Sync [#hisSync]
*******************

Novant connectors do not support 'hisCollect'.  History can be synced using the
standard SkySpark tools and with Axon using `novantSyncHis`.  For example:

  readAll(point and novantHis).novantSyncHis(2023-02-01)

History sync operates by queueing 'syncHis' requests and attempting to batch
request points in bulk to optimize API requests.
